	<string>After our scheduled arrival in Heathrow Terminal 4 at 7:05am and clearing customs, we’ll follow signs to Heathrow Express (we will take Heathrow Central to Terminal 1). Upon arrival at the Heathrow Express Ticket windows, everyone will give me their Britrail Passes to be validated. Next we’ll board the Heathrow Express non­stop train to Paddington Station, London (your Britrail pass is your ticket). Upon arrival, you will then use your London Travel Card on the London Underground (the tube) to King’s Cross Station. We’ll board our 10:00am train to the ancient Roman city of Eboracum arriving in York, as it is now called at 11:51am. York is historically rich, from York Minster Cathedral, built upon the remains of the Roman fortress in which Constantine&apos;s soldiers declared him Emperor in 306 A.D., to the walls that temporarily halted William Wallace in his march across northern England almost ten centuries later. We&apos;ll walk upon the remains of the city walls (the Roman foundations still exist, but the wall today dates from the medieval period) to Hampton by Hilton York, Toft Green, York, North Yorkshire, Y01 6JT, United Kingdom (Tel: 011­44­1904­681­240 and Fax: 011­44­1904­ 681­241). After check in, at 12:30pm we’ll walk past Clifford&apos;s Tower, one of two Norman castles built by William the Conqueror to subdue the North after his victory over Harold in 1066. The original wooden structure was burned in 1190 during a persecution of York’s Jews. Seeking refuge in the tower but betrayed by townsfolk, the Jews set the tower ablaze­­preferring death by fire to being murdered by their persecutors. The Clifford’s Tower was rebuilt in the 13th century by Henry III. You should have time for tea or a quick lunch and a walk through the medieval town center known as &quot;the Shambles.&quot; At 2:55pm, we’ll meet at the West End Entrance Door of York Minster [3£, exact change] to visit this remarkable Cathedral, site of Constantine’s initial rise to power in the early 4th century A.D. (you are required to visit the Undercroft). Later, as Emperor, Constantine shifted Roman and world history for all time by proclaiming “perfect religious freedom” throughout the Roman Empire in 313 A.D. His Edict of Milan ended centuries of Roman persecution of Christians. You may climb the tower [5£] for a fine view of this medieval city. At 5:15pm, we’ll exit the Cathedral, meet for dinner, and return to the hotel to get some much needed sleep.Hotel Curfew 7:45pm/Room Curfew 8:15pm [total 3­8£] [miles walked 8]Evening Reading: Benedict of Nursia The Benedictine Rule</string>
	<string>We&apos;ll go for an easy 30:00 run at 7:40am, eat breakfast at 8:55am and depart at 9:40am on our private coach for a tour of the Yorkshire countryside. We arrive at 11:00am to tour Rievaulx Abbey, one of the many casualties of Henry VIII’s war against the Church. What remains of Rievaulx is a remarkable monument to the artistry and creativity of the Middle Ages that illustrates two of St. Benedict’s mottos—“ora et labora,” and “succisa virescit.” The ruins of Rievaulx also remind us of Henry&apos;s abuse of his power as defined by the Magna Carta and the resulting destruction of human life and institutions. After touring the ruined abbey and grounds, at 12:30pm we&apos;ll head to Helmsley, site of Helmsley Castle, a formidable 12th century Norman structure (arrive 12:45pm). After lunch and a look around this classic Yorkshire market town, we&apos;ll return to York (departing at 2:30pm; arriving at 3:30pm) where you are required to visit one of five museums: the Yorkshire Museum and Gardens [7£], noting the Roman and medieval ruins on site; the Jorvik Viking Center [9.75£]; the York Castle Museum [8.50£]; the Roman Bath Museum [3.50£]; or the National Rail Museum [free]. After dinner we’ll return to the hotel for a good night&apos;s sleep.

	<string>We’ll go for an easy 30:00 run at 6:00am followed by breakfast at 7:15am. Using our Britrail passes, we’ll depart at 8:00am for our 8:33am train to Durham (arrives 9:13am), resting place of both St. Cuthbert and the medieval historian Bede (upon entering the Cathedral feel free to make a donation). Lindisfarne Priory was a cultural center from which most of Northumbria had been converted to Christianity after the pagan onslaught following Rome’s departure. Facing another invasion in the 9th century, this time by the Vikings, the monks abandoned Lindisfarne. They took with them the body of St. Cuthbert and his sacred relics, as well as the Lindisfarne gospels, to settle in Durham. The Cathedral is also known for its remarkable ribbed stone vaulting (a technological innovation that eventually led to Gothic architecture), as well as many other important historical artifacts located in the Treasury [3£]. Durham Cathedral is a masterpiece of mature Romanesque architecture in an incomparable setting. As Sir Walter Scott described Durham Cathedral, it is “half Church of God, half castle ‘gainst the Scot.’” At 11:30am we’ll head back to the rail station (you can grab something quick for lunch en route) to board our private coach at 12:00Noon that will take us to what was the edge of the vast Roman Empire in the 2nd century A.D.—Housesteads Roman Fort, one of the 16 Roman forts which defended Hadrian’s Wall (the frontier between Roman civilization and “Barbarism” that some say was built by the Emperor because the Scots were too tough to conquer). Arriving at 1:00pm, we will examine the remains of Vercovicium, the Roman name for this hilltop fortress which means “place of the effective fighters.” Housesteads is the most complete Roman fort in Britain, and combined with the new museum we can glimpse into what life was possibly like for the soldiers who garrisoned the fort. At 3:00pm we’ll hike alongside the remains of Hadrian’s Wall for three miles to Steel Rigg, passing spectacular sites along the way, including Highshield Crags overlooking Crag Lough. At Steel Rigg we’ll board our coach at 5:45pm and return to Durham rail station for our 7:08pm train to York (arriving at 8:07pm). After a quick dinner we’ll return to the hotel, pack for our trip to London, settle all bills and get much needed sleep.Hotel Curfew 9:20pm/Room Curfew 9:40pm [total 3£] [miles walked 10] Evening Reading: William Wordsworth “On Returning to London” The Prelude; Jack House, ed.

We’ll use our Britrail passes and arrive at King’s Cross station by 10:04am. Next, we’ll use our London underground pass to take “the tube” (Bayswater or even better Queensway tube stops) as we head for the Holiday Villa Hotel, 37 Leinster Gardens, W2 3AN, London, England (Tel: 011­44­207­258­0269 and Fax: 011­44­207­723­7295). After check in and storing our bags, at 11:00am we&apos;ll head for a site rich in English history: Westminster Abbey [9£] located near Westminster station. Exiting the station we’ll pass by Big Ben, Parliament, and the monument to Queen Boudicca of the ancient Iceni tribe who led a failed rebellion against the Roman occupation of Britain, 60­61 A.D. Westminster Abbey (arrive 11:40am) has been the scene of coronations, marriages, and burials of almost every English monarch. At 12:50pm we’ll head for the Imperial War Museum located near Lambeth North Station. Upon arrival (1:30pm), we’ll meet one of the chief historians and directors of the IWM, Terry Charman. Mr. Charman is the author of several books on the First and Second World War, creator of the IWM Holocaust exhibit, and a key figure in the recent renovation of the IWM for the Centenary Anniversary of the beginning of World War I (August, 1914 Germany launched Operation Belgium Overrun, the first stage of the Schlieffen Plan designed to conquer all of Europe). Mr. Charman will briefly speak to us about the history of the museum and provide salient points with respect to the various exhibits. You are required to visit the World War I and World War II exhibits, as well as the Holocaust exhibit. At 6:00pm we’ll meet outside the museum, disperse for dinner, and return to the hotel for some much needed sleep.Hotel Curfew 9:00pm/Room Curfew 9:15pm [total 9£] [miles walked 8]Evening Reading: “Old Sarum;” Mike Pitts Hengeworld; English Heritage “Stonehenge;” “Archaeological Landscape of Salisbury Plain: Stonehenge Cursus, North Kite, Stonehenge Avenue, Vespasian’s Camp, Durrington Walls, Woodhenge;” Vincent Janoski, ed. “King John” Sparknotes 101: Shakespeare; Publisher’s Note “The Theatrical World” ThePelican Shakespeare; B.F.

	<string>After a 45:00 run in Hyde Park at 6:55am, we&apos;ll eat breakfast at 8:25am, and depart at 9:10am for the National Gallery (arrive 10:00am) which houses a collection of every European school of painting from 1260­1900, including works by Leonardo da Vinci, Caravaggio, Van Dyck, Rembrandt, Goya, Monet, Degas, Turner, and Picasso (www.nationalgallery.org.uk). Walking up to the museum we&apos;ll pass through Trafalgar Square, a site memorializing Lord Nelson&apos;s greatest triumph (October 21, 1805) which established Britain as the mistress of the seas in perhaps the most decisive major naval victory, tactically and strategically, of history. After viewing the collection, at 11:30am we’ll head for Waterloo station (grab something quick for lunch to eat on the train) to catch our train to Salisbury (departs Waterloo 12:20pm and arrives Salisbury 1:43pm). Salisbury is famous for its magnificent Cathedral, and the town is located near the site of the signing of the Magna Carta in 1215. The Cathedral houses the best preserved of the four existing original copies of the remarkable document. After viewing the Cathedral and the Magna Carta, you should be back at the rail station no later than 3:40pm to board our Lancaster private coach. Arriving at 4:10pm, we will view possibly the oldest site in Britain, the 5,000 year old Iron Age fort known as Old Sarum, a site many historians believe predates even Stonehenge. At 5:15pm we’ll board our coach and head for dinner arriving at 5:30pm at the Wheatsheaf in Lower Woodford [12£]. After dinner, at 7:40pm we will travel to one of the oldest, most enigmatic, best preserved megalithic structures on earth: Stonehenge (arrive at 8:15pm—30 minutes before our entry time as a group which is scheduled for 8:45pm). The subject of a vast number of works, Stonehenge has fascinated many who have seen it for centuries. Thomas Hardy, in his famous work Tess of the D’Urbervilles, describes Tess waking up at Stonehenge where “it seem[ed] as if there were no folks in the world.” William Wordsworth on his famous trek from the Isle of Wight to Northern Wales in 1793 was later inspired to write the poem Salisbury Plain with one stanza statingThe Sun unheeded sunk, while on a mound He stands beholding with astonished gaze, Frequent upon the deep entrenched ground, Strange marks of mighty arms of former days, Then looking up at distance he surveys What seems an antique castle spreading wide. Hoary and naked are its walls and raise Their brow sublime; while to those walls he hiedA voice as from a tomb in hollow accents cried.You will have the opportunity to walk inside the 5,000 year old stone circle, what Wordsworth calls “the eternal pile which frowns on Sarum’s Plain,” as opposed to the normally restrictive perimeter access. We will enter the site at 8:45pm; the visit will end at 9:45pm. After entry we will split into two groups which will alternate 30 minutes of Stone Circle access and 30 minutes of perimeter access. Departing at 10:00pm, we’ll return by coach to our hotel in London. Arriving at 11:55pm, we’ll go straight to our rooms for some much needed sleep.Hotel Curfew immediate/Room Curfew immediate [total 12£] [miles walked 8.5] Evening Reading: No Assignment</string>

At 12:50pm we’ll head for the British Library (about 200 yards from the King’s Cross St. Pancras station; arriving at 1:20pm) to examine an original copy of Beowulf, the Magna Carta, ancient copies of the Bible (including the Lindisfarne gospels and the Gutenberg Bible), an original manuscript of Chaucer&apos;s Canterbury Tales, Newton&apos;s Principia, works by Shakespeare, Bach, Handel, Austen, and much more—all in the permanent collection on display. Next, at 2:15pm we’ll head for the Cabinet War Rooms and Churchill Museum, near Westminster station. We’ll enter the CWR possibly in two groups, 3:00pm and 3:30pm. Churchill, like Roosevelt, rejected the conventional wisdom of his day and refused to even meet with Hitler. He remarked on his first visit to the underground Cabinet War Rooms that &quot;it is from here that I will direct the war.” After our visit, we’ll meet at 5:30pm to head for dinner and then on to the Globe Theater to see the play King John by William Shakespeare. The play begins promptly at 7:30pm—be ready to enter by 7:15pm. We will see the play at the reconstructed Globe Theater, the fruit of American actor Sam Wanamaker&apos;s life­long dream to restore this historical site through a painstakingly accurate recreation of the famous structure (the Globe is located near Mansion House tube station). After the play it will be late, so we&apos;ll go straight to our hotel for some much needed sleep.Hotel Curfew immediate/Room Curfew immediate [total 0£] [miles walked 7]Evening Reading: No assignment</string>

Among many exhibits, you will see the &quot;unbreakable&quot; German cipher machine, the Enigma, and you will have the opportunity to view the world&apos;s first computer, the Colossus, created to help the code breakers solve the Enigma intercepts (known as Ultra). Upon arrival we&apos;ll meet our guide and begin our 12:00pm to 1:00pm tour of the principle sites at Bletchley (inhabited for 2000 years­­from Roman times to the present). After the tour you will have 45 minutes to grab a quick lunch and some time to explore on your own. We will meet in front of the mansion at 3:20pm to head for the rail station for our return to London (train departs Bletchley 3:46pm; arrives Euston 4:37pm).

After entering the terminal, you will also pass through security, and you will present your passport to the French officers. The Eurostar service includes a full breakfast en route. We&apos;ll travel under the channel via the &quot;Chunnel,&quot; (Channel Tunnel), a marvel of 20th­century engineering (arriving Gare du Nord at 11:17am). En route, you will need to give Mr. Tribble your Eurail passes and passports as we will need to validate them upon arrival (note that your Eurostar ticket is not your Eurail pass—do not write in your Eurail pass until you are told to do so). Upon arrival, in groups of four, you will each need to purchase a carnet de Métro [10 tickets in the carnet cost 14€—you will need exact change for this—you can purchase this at a Tabac or downstairs at a ticket office or ticket machine; note­­if you are more than four in your group you may be turned away for service at a Tabac]. You should have time to get a quick snack or sandwich at the station. At 12:15pm we’ll cross the street to check in and store our bags at our hotel, the Hôtel Mercure Paris Terminus Nord, 12 Boulevard de Denain, Ile de France, 75010, Paris (Tel: 011­33­1­ 4280­2000; Fax: 011­33­1­4280­6389).

We’ll board our 10:28am Train (TGV #2713) to Reims (arrives 11:16am). Upon arrival, we’ll board our private coach which takes us to the city center. Important since Roman times, Reims was the site of the coronation of France’s monarchs for centuries. Here Joan of Arc, who Winston Churchill called an “Angel of Deliverance for France...the true warrior,” fulfilled her Divine Mission in 1429 when the Dauphin was crowned Charles VII at Reims Cathedral. At Reims, 1000 years before the time of Joan, Clovis became the first Germanic king to be baptized a Christian fulfilling his vow to do so if he triumphed over his enemy the Alemanni at the Battle of Tolbiac in 496 A.D. His baptism began a series of events that led to a Christian France and the Christianization of all Europe under Clovis’ remarkable descendant, Charlemagne, King of the Franks and Holy Roman Emperor in 800A.D. From 11:30am to 12:15pm we will visit Reims Cathedral, see the baptismal font of Clovis, as well as magnificent statues of Joan of Arc. Reims was nearly destroyed by German bombardment in World War I, but the city was rebuilt and thrives today. The Cathedral was rebuilt by donations from John D. Rockefeller. One hundred years ago this summer Germany executed the Schlieffen plan, a plan designed in 1891 to swiftly conquer Europe in a matter of weeks: the plan failed, and the Great War was the result. By 1916 hundreds of thousands of casualties had been inflicted on both sides. Hoping to end the stalemate by destroying the French army and French morale, the German High Command planned to “bleed the French white.” Code named Gericht (seat of judgment), Germany attacked in the Verdun sector on February 21 believing correctly the French would defend Verdun at all costs. French General Pétain’s remark “Ils ne passeront pas!” (they shall not pass) became France’s motto for the rest of the war, and ironically by December 18 it was Germany that had been defeated and “bled white.” France was victorious but exhausted. As Sir Alistair Horne in his classic work The Price of Glory makes clear, any hope of Allied Victory now depended upon America’s might of arms and men. Horne calls Verdun the most terrible battle in history, with France losing 542,000 men and Germany 434,000. Following Verdun, Germany’s unrestricted submarine warfare and the shock of the Zimmermann intercept moved President Wilson to finally abandon neutrality and ask Congress for a War Declaration in 1917. Under the command of American General John J. Pershing, the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) fought independently of the Allies. Pershing’s Separate Forces Concept—initially resisted by the other Allied commanders­­ underscored America’s cooperation with Allied Forces only, as no formal U.S. alliance with France or England existed. Pershing’s AEF was the crucial element in halting the last German offensive of the war. Germany was forced to finally retreat all along the Western Front during the decisive U.S. led Meuse­ Argonne Offensive from September to November, 1918, the battle that turned the tide of the war. Victor DuPuy has stated that the question of whether or not America’s all­out effort on land, sea, and air played the decisive role in the final Allied victory is so well established that it should not even be debated. At 12:20pm we’ll board our coach and depart to visit one of the most important sites of the First World War: the Meuse­Argonne Battlefield. Arriving at 1:50pm at Châtel­Chéhéry, we will hike the Sgt. York Historic Trail. At 3:00pm we will board our private coach and depart for two of the most important French forts in the Verdun sector, Fort Douaumont and Fort Vaux. Arriving at 4:00pm, we will tour both Forts [combined cost for both forts is 8€­­you will need exact change for this]. At 5:00pm we will board our coach for Metz to return to Paris (TGV #2676 departs Metz at 6:56pm; arrives Paris Est at 8:20pm). At the Metz station, be sure to note the stained glass window of Charlemagne, as well as Kaiser Wilhelm II’s attempt to “Germanify” the area through the station’s architecture. Metz station was a key element in the transportation of troops from France to Russia as part of the failed Schlieffen Plan with wider berths for the military trains still visible today. We’ll eat a quick dinner in Paris and return to our hotel for much needed sleep—make sure to settle any bills and pack before retiring as we check out in the morning.Hotel Curfew 10:20pm/Room Curfew 10:35pm [total 8€] [miles walked 9]Evening Reading: Winston Churchill “The Norman Invasion” A History of the English Speaking Peoples.</string>

We should have enough time at Gare St. Lazare to buy provisions for lunch to be eaten en route to Bayeux. Upon arrival in Bayeux, we’ll meet our guide and store our bags in our private coach which will be waiting for us at the train station. We will go directly to the Notre Dame de Bayeux Cathedral, site of Saint Thomas à Becket’s final mass before his return to England and subsequent murder in Canterbury Cathedral (view Cathedral 12:40pm to 1:10pm). At 1:10pm we’ll head for the Bayeux Tapestry Museum (arriving for our 1:20pm viewing). La Tapisserie de Bayeux is an excellent example of medieval craftsmanship and artistry, as well as a historical document of William, Duke of Normandy and his conquest of England. At 1:50pm we’ll return to our coach (depart 2:00pm) for a tour of the Norman countryside and another example of the vitality and creativity of medieval Europe: Mont Saint Michel. More stone was quarried to build the cathedrals and churches during the Middle Ages in France alone than for all the pyramids of ancient Egypt, and Mont St. Michel is a striking example of the beautiful architecture and brilliant engineering mastered by the French during this period. Arriving at 3:45pm we&apos;ll tour Mont St. Michel. At 7:00pm we’ll return to Bayeux, arriving at 8:45pm to check into the hotel, the Hotel Churchill, 14­16 Rue Saint Jean, 14400 Bayeux, France (Tel: 011­33­231­21­31­ 80) .

	<string>At 6:30am we&apos;ll go for a 30:00 easy run followed by breakfast at 7:45am. At 8:30am we&apos;ll board our private coach to begin our examination of D­Day, June 6, 1944, which Stephen Ambrose called &quot;the climactic battle of World War II.&quot; In Operation Overlord, described by Churchill as “the most complex and difficult military operation ever undertaken,” the Americans led an Allied force that included large British and Canadian units, as well as Free French, French Resistance, Polish, Norwegian, and many other nationalities. We will look at Allied and American sites that illustrate Churchill’s observation. First we’ll examine the site of the U.S. 82nd Airborne’s decisive victory in a three­day battle at St. Mere Eglise. Passing through the village, the strategically vital road N­13 allowed the Germans access to the port of Cherbourg in the north, the major rail center of Caen in the east, and on into Paris. Arriving at 10:00am we’ll have time to view the famous church, the first U.S. flag flown to signify liberation, as well as the airborne museum before eating lunch in the market square (11:40am­12:30pm). After lunch we will visit several sites including the “Iron Mike” Airborne Trooper monument at the Merderet river. The small stone bridge was vital for the Germans to disrupt the landings at Utah Beach, and a fierce four day battle took place here (June 6­9). The Germans attacked over and over again with heavily armed infantry and even tanks, but remarkably the battle was still won by the lightly armed American soldiers. We’ll also visit the German strong point of la pointe du Hoc (arrive 1:15pm), site of the remarkable efforts made by the U.S. Army Rangers to scale the vertical cliffs under intense fire before defeating the German defenders and ultimately locating and destroying key German artillery. A flashlight will be handy for viewing some of the remains of the underground bunkers. At 2:25pm we’ll depart for Omaha Beach (arrive 2:55pm) and the adjacent U.S. Cemetery where over 9,000 Americans who sacrificed their lives for freedom are buried. Though the Americans eventually prevailed at the battle of “bloody Omaha,” at one point the U.S. losses were so great that the entire D­Day invasion was nearly recalled. At 4:45pm we’ll depart for Arromanches (arrive 5:15pm), the site of one of two massive artificial ports conceived by Winston Churchill and built for American and British forces (Arromanches was built for the British). These were the only ports available to the Allies at the time, and they represent another example of Churchill’s brilliant vision and imagination. We will visit the Musée du Débarquement (museum visit 5:20pm­6:20pm). Departing at 6:25pm, we’ll end the day (arrive Bayeux 6:55pm) with dinner and then return to our hotel for some much needed sleep.

	<string>After a 30:00 run at 6:05am, we’ll eat breakfast at 7:15am. We’ll depart the hotel at 7:55am for our 8:37am train (#3302) to Paris (arrives Gare St. Lazare at 10:46am). We’ll first head by Metro to the Gare de l’Est to store our bags [5€—you will need exact change for this—save money by sharing a locker if possible]. At 12:00Noon we&apos;ll head by Metro to one of the most important sites in Paris, the 12th Century Cathédrale Notre Dame de Paris, with its magnificent portals and stained glass windows. Arriving at 12:30pm we will visit the Cathedral until 1:15pm when we’ll disperse for lunch at one of the many nearby cafés. At 2:30pm we’ll begin our walk along the Seine River to the Musée d’Orsay, (arrive 3:10pm) with its collection of Impressionistic art, including works by Monet, Degas, Renoir, Pissarro, Cezanne, Van Gogh, Whistler, and Mary Cassatt. At 4:45pm we’ll return to the Gare de l’Est (arrive no later than 5:30pm) retrieve our bags and eat dinner in the station so that we’ll be on the platform no later than 6:45pm ready to board our 7:06pm train to Mannheim, ICE #9559, arrives Mannheim 10:17pm; change in Mannheim for our train to Berlin CNL #40459 departing at 11:59pm (arriving Saturday morning, Berlin Hbf—Main Station—at 7:19am). After boarding the train, we will first go directly to our compartments to get settled. You will need to follow carefully the instructions given to you at this time by the Night Conductor of your train car. Please remember, your sleeping compartment is your room, and no mixed visitation is allowed. If you plan to recite Skimbleshanks we should have time upon our arrival in Mannheim. You will also have another recital chance June 17 at the Villach station before we board the train to Rome. You may of course briefly leave your compartment to use the bathroom and/or shower after the curfew—but do not leave your train car.Compartment Curfew Immediate As We Board Berlin Train [total 5 €] [miles walked 9] Evening Reading: Dinesh D’Souza, “How Reagan Won the Cold War” National Review November 24, 1997; T.S.

	<string>Arriving at 7:19am at Berlin Hbf, we&apos;ll first store our bags [4€—you will need exact change for this—the baggage storage is next to Bahnsteig (Track) # 14. After storing your bags you can eat a quick breakfast in the station if the train breakfast was not sufficient, and then you will need to buy provisions for your lunch also in the station. At 8:50am we’ll depart for the city center (your Eurail pass is your S­Bahn/U­Bahn ticket) to observe two sites that for decades represented the tyranny of Communism and a divided Germany after World War II: the Brandenburg Gate and Checkpoint Charlie. The Brandenburg gate is the site of President Reagan&apos;s decisive challenge to the Communists on June 12, 1987: &quot;Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!&quot; Today, the gate once again represents the entry into a great city. The Haus Am Checkpoint Charlie is a museum dedicated to preserving the memory of those who risked their lives and those who were killed trying to escape the Communism of the East for the freedom of the West by crossing the Wall. On November 10, 1989, thousands of East Germans answered President Reagan’s challenge (located upstairs in the museum is a gallery dedicated exclusively to Ronald Reagan) and tore down the wall, and the Brandenburg gate became a place of celebration for the German people from both the East and the West. Arriving at 10:00am, we’ll first visit Haus am Checkpoint Charlie [9.50€]. Make sure to view the various large displays of creative ways people managed to escape to freedom, as well as the room dedicated to President Ronald Reagan located about the mid point of the upstairs gallery of rooms. Departing the museum at 11:20am, we’ll walk toward the city center following the route of the former wall etched into the street with stones while also seeing a large section of the former wall en route (this would be a good time to eat your on­the­go lunch). We will also see another example of the destructive force of National Socialism, the solemn site of the “Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe,” designed by American architect Peter Eisenman and located on the grounds of Hitler’s now demolished chancellery building and nearby Führer bunker. Spend at least 15 minutes walking around and through the enigmatic memorial blocks, before entering the Holocaust Memorial museum located beneath the site. At 12:55pm we’ll head for the iconic Brandenburg Gate, and then on to the Gemaldegalerie, walking through the beautiful park known as the Tiergarten. En route, we’ll also pass by the infamous “T­4” site, arguably the site where the Holocaust began with the Nazi “Euthanasia” program in the 1930s. Next, arriving by 1:25pm at the Gemäldegalerie we will view one of the world’s greatest European collections of art from the 13th through 18th centuries including masterpieces by Cranach, van Eyck, Bruegel, Durer, Raphael, Titian, Caravaggio, Rubens, Vermeer, and Rembrandt. At 3:20pm we’ll leave the museum to retrieve our bags at the Berlin Hbf. Next, we’ll board our 4:40pm train ICE # 1715) to Weimar, the cultural center of Germany (arrives Naumberg 6:29pm—change to train ICE#1542—departs Naumberg 6:36pm—arrives Weimar 7:00pm). Weimar illustrates well what historians refer to as the &quot;dual nature of German culture,&quot; the zwei Seelen Deutschland (Germany&apos;s two souls). Observing Germany&apos;s historically dichotomous nature, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749­ 1832) said, &quot;I have often felt a bitter sorrow at the thought of the German people, which is so estimable in the individual and so wretched in the generality....&quot; Arriving in what was for many years after World War II East Germany, the city of Weimar is the city of Goethe and Bach, the Bauhaus art movement, as well as the city where Germany&apos;s first­ever Republic, the short­lived Weimar Republic was founded (1919). Yet, just a few miles away are the remains of the infamous Konzentrationslager Buchenwald. Upon arrival we&apos;ll take taxis [3€—you will need exact change for this] to the Leonardo Hotel Weimar, Belvederer Allee 25, Weimar, Germany, D­99425 (Tel: 011­49­3643­722­2310 and Fax: 011­49­ 3643­722­2320). After check in, we’ll eat dinner at the hotel and then retire for some much needed sleep.

	<string>We’ll go for an easy 45:00 run this morning at 7:25am in the Schloss­Park (which Goethe designed—today it remains as he conceived it) and passing by his Gartenhaus where he lived and wrote some of his most well­known works. At 8:55am we&apos;ll eat breakfast, and then board our coach at 9:55am to depart at 10:00am to visit a site whose name became synonymous with cruelty after World War II: KZ Buchenwald. We&apos;ll view the remains of this infamous site, as well as the superb museum from 10:30pm to 1:25pm. Then we&apos;ll board our coach and depart at 1:30pm in order to return to Weimar (arrive 1:50pm) to eat a late lunch near the statues of Goethe and Schiller. At 3:00pm, we’ll visit the Weimar Stadtkirche where Martin Luther preached many Reformation sermons. As we approach the 500th anniversary of Luther posting his 95 Theses on the door of All Saints’ Church in Wittenberg, it is fitting that we will view Lucas Cranach’s remarkable triptych altarpiece (he worked on the painting from 1552­ 1553—later the painting was completed by Cranach’s son). With its powerful Reformation message of Sola Scriptura (“by Scripture alone”), all major themes of the Bible are depicted in this fascinating painting. At 4:00pm we’ll visit the Bauhaus museum [3.50€—you will need exact change] in groups of four (finish by 4:55pm and meet in front of the museum). The Bauhaus is the birthplace of much of what is today called &quot;modern.&quot; The essence of the Bauhaus movement as taught by the abstract painters Paul Klee, Wassily Kandinsky, and founder of the Bauhaus in Weimar, Walter Gropius, among others was to &quot;eliminate the distinction between the abstract design of the artist and the concrete creation of the craftsman by making affordable products with clean, simple lines.&quot; After seeing this unique museum and excellent film on the Bauhuas movement we’ll continue to explore and enjoy the restored beauty of what was, incredibly, only a few years ago a crumbling city—the result of years of Communist abuse and neglect. We’ll examine the life of Goethe more closely by walking through the park to tour his first residence in the city and favorite retreat, his Gartenhaus, from 5:20pm to 5:50pm [3€—you will need exact change]. After this visit we’ll eat dinner and return to the hotel to pack for our trip to Salzburg, Austria. Make sure to settle all bills and check out before returning to your room for some much needed sleep—we have a very early departure tomorrow morning.Hotel Curfew 8:30pm/Room Curfew 9:00pm [total 6.50€] [miles walked 9]Evening Reading: No assignment</string>

At 6:40am we’ll load our bags onto our coach and go directly to the rail station to catch our 7:18am train to Salzburg via Würzburg and Munich. First we depart Weimar at 7:18am Train #R3642—arrive Würzburg 9:55am; depart Würzburg Train #ICE527 10:04am—arrive Munich 12:12pm; [at this point you should eat lunch in the station mindful of the next train departing for Salzburg]. Next, depart Munich 1:34pm Train #RJ67—arrive Salzburg Hbf 3:02pm. Arriving in Salzburg, we’ll head to the Hotel Bristol, 4 Makartplatz, Salzburg, Austria, 5020 (Tel: 011­43­662­873­557 and Fax 011­43­662­873­5576) to check in. As you explore Salzburg (starting at 3:50pm—see the three Churches before 6:30pm), one of the oldest market towns in Europe, you should view the following sites: the Mirabell Gardens, the Getreidegasse with its traditional shops, the Franziskanerkirche, the Stiftskirche St. Peter, the Dom, and the Mönchsberg (from this high point you get a spectacular view of the entire city, especially at sunset). After dinner we’ll return to our hotel rooms for much needed sleep.Hotel Curfew 9:25pm/Room Curfew 9:35pm [total 0€] [miles walked 8]Evening Reading: Primo Levi “On the Bottom” Survival in Auschwitz; Primo Levi “The Grey Zone” The Drowned and the Saved.</string>

At 9:00am we&apos;ll start our run following the Rundwanderweg through dense forest with spectacular views of Salzburg and the surrounding countryside. At 11:55 we&apos;ll board our coach and head to St. Gilgen (birthplace of Mozart’s mother and home of his sister for several years) where we’ll spend a relaxing day at this resort village by the Wolfgangsee named for the 7th­century Saint Giles. You will need to buy provisions for lunch tomorrow during our tour of the Ebensee Camp. After an early dinner we’ll depart by coach at 5:00pm returning to our hotel briefly to change for a chamber music concert in the Schloss Mirabell in the very room where Mozart performed for audiences in his youth. At this time you should pack your bags as tomorrow evening we will be taking a night train to Italy. We should have time to walk about the famous Mirabell Gardens before we enter the castle no later than 7:40pm (the concert begins promptly at 8:00pm). After the concert we’ll return to the hotel to settle any bills and pack our bags for departure early tomorrow morning.

We&apos;ll change trains and depart at 10:11am train (Rex # 3412) arriving in Ebensee (first station­­ Landungsplatz) at 10:44am. We&apos;ll see beautiful views of the countryside en route to an infamous site that is utterly incongruous with its surroundings: KZ Ebensee. First, we will meet our guide Dr. Wolfgang Quatember, director of the Verein Wiederstandsmuseum. First, we&apos;ll tour the museum (3€—you will need exact change for this) and learn of Austria’s history in the rise of the Nazis and Hitler, as well as background on KZ Ebensee through the video testimony of a survivor of the camp who now lives in the United States of America. Later, we’ll go by coach to the site in order to walk the infamous Lowengang to the camp gate, the exact route taken by the prisoners each day. In addition to visiting the memorial site dedicated to the thousands who died working at the camp, we&apos;ll have a unique opportunity to examine the unfinished tunnels (bring your flashlight) dug by the prisoners. As a direct result of American and British strategic bombing, the Nazis were compelled to place much of their war production in underground facilities. At KZ Ebensee, the prisoners were forced by the Nazis to work as slave laborers in horrible conditions to build five miles of tunnels to house the research and production of the &quot;Amerika Rocket,&quot; the world&apos;s first inter­continental rocket project designed to attack the city of New York from bases in Germany. The director of the project­­it was never completed­­was Wernher von Braun. Captured at the end of WWII by American forces, and with Germany defeated and no longer an American enemy, somewhat ironically von Braun was taken to the United States to help engineer and guide America’s space program. Later, von Braun fathered the United States&apos; Apollo program that succeeded in landing men on the moon and returning them safely— thus decisively defeating the Soviets who never advanced their space program enough to even make the attempt. At the end of our visit, we’ll return to the station by our coach and depart Ebensee at 3:14pm (train REX #3423) for Attnang­Puchheim (arriving 3:46pm); change trains for Salzburg, departing 4:00pm (train IC#646) arriving Salzburg Hbf 4:48pm.

After boarding the train, we will go directly to our compartments as we will need a good deal of sleep.

A note about how you dress in Italy: you will need to wear clothing that is acceptable to the Italian authorities when we visit sacred sites like churches. Shorts are not allowed for boys or girls; for the girls bare shoulders and short skirts are not allowed—skirts must be below the knee. No sleeveless shirts. The Italian dress code is more stringent than our standard for this course, and it applies for the rest of our visit in Italy). At 10:45am we’ll head to the ancient site of San Pietro in Vincoli (arriving 11:10am) to visit two of Rome’s greatest treasures: the chains that bound Saint Peter when he was a prisoner in Jerusalem and Michelangelo’s remarkable statue of Moses (overcome with joy and awe, it is said Michelangelo exclaimed to the completed statue of Moses, striking one of Moses’ knees with his hammer, “why do you not speak?”). After meeting our guide, at 11:40am we’ll walk to the Coliseum, a testament to Rome’s inventiveness­­but also to its brutality (arrive 12:00Noon). Historian Lewis Lord has observed that during the Empire Romans lived in a world of “unrelenting cruelty.” Nowhere can we imagine this state of things more clearly than in the Coliseum itself where wild animals were slaughtered, gladiators fought to the death, and Christian men and women, known to the Romans as bestiarii, were thrown to the beasts alive. Many historians believe that during the generations of operation as many as two million people perished at this site, now used as a Church resting upon consecrated ground. At 1:30pm we’ll pass by the Arch of Constantine, built in 315 A.D. to commemorate Constantine’s victory over Maxentius, en route to the Forum Romanum—Rome’s foundation as a world capital, as well as the political, commercial, and social center of Rome, and by extension, arguably the center of the ancient world—first during the Republic and later during the Empire. At 3:15pm we’ll head to the nearby Musei Capitolini. The Capitoline Museums have been called by many art historians the finest museums in the world. Designed by Michelangelo, these museums hold numerous art and archeological treasures, including an original equestrian statue of Emperor Marcus Aurelius, pieces from the Colossus of Constantine, sculpture of the dying Gaul, and the original bronze She­Wolf suckling Romulus and Remus donated by Pope Sixtus IV [enter in groups of 4 no later than 3:35pm]. At 6:00pm we’ll meet and disperse for dinner. At this time, you may want to visit the nearby Circo Massimo, site of the infamous chariot races and Christian martyrdom for generations. Many historians argue that more Christians were martyred here than in the Coliseum. Later, we’ll return to the hotel for some much needed sleep.Hotel Curfew 9:00pm/Room Curfew 9:30pm [total 16.50€] [miles walked 12]Evening Reading: Giorgio Vasari “Life of Michelangelo” Lives of the Artists; H.W.

We’ll then commence an extensive visit of the Vatican art and artifact collection, including the original Laocoon group, Michelangelo’s Sistine Chapel and Pieta, the Raphael room including his painting of the School of Athens, paintings by Giotto and Leonardo, as well as Saint Peter’s Basilica, the final resting place of St. Peter. At 2:00pm we’ll rest a bit and eat a late lunch (until 3pm) and then head to the remarkable Pantheon built by Agrippa in the 1st­century B.C. and later rebuilt by Emperor Hadrian in the 2nd­century A. D. Since the 7th­century A.D. the Pantheon has served as a Christian Church consecrated to Mary and the Christian martyrs. At 4:30pm we’ll disperse for a relaxing dinner. The Mamertine Prison (Carcere Mamertino) that held the Apostles Peter and Paul before their executions (for Paul, see Acts 28:16­31; for Peter, see II Timothy 2:1­10) is nearby the forum and the Capitoline Museums. It is a very worthwhile visit to be sure (last entry is 6:20pm—price is 5€). Perhaps you will also want to go and see the Trevi fountain and ensure your return to Rome one day by turning your back to the fountain and tossing in a coin. Later we’ll return to our hotel to pack for our trip to Florence, settle any bills, and get some good sleep.Hotel Curfew 9:00pm/Room Curfew 9:25pm [total 0€] [miles walked 9]Evening Reading: Augustine City of God.</string>

Then at 9:40am we’ll head for the remarkable Duomo (impressive views of the city may be seen from the top of either the Duomo or the Campanile—8€). At 12:30pm we’ll eat lunch en route to visit the remarkable Santa Croce [4€—arrive by 2:15pm] which contains tombs of Michelangelo, Machiavelli, and Galileo, as well as frescoes by Giotto. We’ll depart at 3:30pm, and at this point disperse to explore the city and later have dinner. If you have not already done so you should be sure to cross the Arno river at the Ponte Vecchio, the only bridge in Florence the retreating German commander refused (against orders) to destroy during the Second World War. Near the Ponte Vecchio, you may also wish to examine The Institute and Museum of the History of Science, the Museo Galileo, location Piazza de Giudici. Also, the remarkable workshop that carries on today a Florentine art tradition of inlaid stone work dating back to the 15th century (located a few hundred yards from Santa Croce on the Via De’ Macci, 9), the workshop known as I Mosaici Di Lastrucci, is certainly worth a visit.

Donato). Dorothy Wordsworth visiting Milan with her husband William in 1820 writes in her journal account that she “ascended to the roof where I remained alone...surrounded by silent statues—saints, sages, and angels...impossible for me to describe the beautiful spectacle.” Herman Melville described the Duomo as “Glorious,” and he thought he might write a travel book while sitting on the roof. Mark Twain commented that in his day people said the Milan Cathedral was second only to St. Peter’s in Rome which prompted him to observe in his work Innocents Abroad “I cannot understand how it can be second to anything made by human hands.” In the early 5th­century on this site, St. Ambrose built a new basilica where he later baptized his student St. Augustine. Centuries later, after a fire damaged the basilica in 1075, the cathedral we will see today was built as the Duomo. The central crucifix was designed by Leonardo da Vinci. At 12:30pm we’ll disperse for lunch. At 1:45pm, we’ll take Line M1 to Cadorna direction Bisceglie. After a brief walk, we’ll arrive at the Church of Santa Maria delle Grazie to see one of the greatest masterpieces in the world, The Last Supper (L’Ultima Cena) by Leonardo da Vinci. In this mural painting, Leonardo depicts the exact moment when Jesus says to His disciples “I tell you the truth, one of you is going to betray me” (John 13:21). We are required by the museum officials to arrive at 2:30pm for our 3:00pm scheduled viewing of the painting (we will divide into two groups with the second group following 15 minutes later).

Along the way to the Schwarzee, you will enjoy a challenging and beautiful hike which should not be rushed: be sure to take the leftward, downward branch at the second fork of the main trail leaving Zermatt (toward the river and crossing a foot bridge—at this point you will begin to see signs for the village of Furi, as well as for our destination of Schwarzee). Remember to maintain a group of four at all times. Upon arrival at the Schwarzee,we’ll have a quick lunch, and those who have proper hiking gear approved by Mr. Tribble may go higher up the trail. You will use your own hiking or trekking shoes that are broken in, or running shoes with the slip on chains called “Yaktrax Walkers,” your rented hiking/trekking pole, from the shop in Zermatt, long pants or wind pants, hat, and gloves, all of which we discussed earlier. We will set out together—and stay together—as we hike the challenging route of the Hornli Trail to the Hornli Hütte, the starting point for actually climbing the Matterhorn. Later we&apos;ll hike down the mountain to Zermatt (the cable car is also an option—make sure you check the time table for final departure times). After dinner, we’ll return to the hotel. We will all need a good night’s sleep after this strenuous day.Hotel Curfew 9:40pm/Room Curfew 10:00pm [total CHF 0­33] [miles walked 7 to 20] Evening Reading: No assignment</string>

After you have checked out and settled any bills, you have many options: shop for some last minute gifts, swim, or go for a relaxing walk around the old part of Zermatt—outside the hotel remember to maintain your group of four­­you could even take a shorter hike like the Edelweiss route and perhaps come across one of these hard­to­find flowers (the sign of a true mountain hiker). It would also be a good idea to buy a few snacks for the flight home. We’ll need to eat a really early dinner and then meet back at the hotel no later than 4:45pm in order to retrieve our bags and catch our 5:35pm train (R #262) to Zurich Airport (Flughaven) via Visp (arrives Visp 6:45pm; change trains for Zurich Flughaven, train IC #833, departs Visp 6:57pm arrives Zurich Airport 9:16pm).
